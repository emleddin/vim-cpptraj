## Style

- Keep `vim` lines to a maximum of 80 characters
(the README is a little more forgiving)
- Keep commands in sections alphabetical, unless it's more logical for similarly
named commands to be grouped together (ex: `xydy xyz xy xz yz`)
- Comment new sections with a quick explanation of what's happening

## Suggested Reading
[Vim Syntax Documentation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html)

Preferred `vim` syntax highlighting groups include:
- Comment
- Constant
- Identifier
- Statement
- PreProc
- Type
- Special
- Underlined
